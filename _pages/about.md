<!-- Write your biography here. -->

I am a **Computational Mathematician** and **Educator** with a unique dual focus: pushing the boundaries of algorithmic complexity while simultaneously making those concepts accessible to the next generation of learners. With a Master's degree specializing in Computational Mathematics, my academic foundation is built on the rigorous study of **Numerical Analysis**, **Optimization**, and **Stochastic Calculus**.

My professional journey is defined by the synergy between these two worlds. My research in numerical methods—specifically in **Kalman Filtering** and **optimization algorithms**—isn't confined to abstract simulations. It directly informs how I structure complex concepts for students. I believe that a deep understanding of the "how" and "why" behind an algorithm allows me to create bridges from abstract theory to tangible understanding, fostering a more intuitive grasp of mathematics in the classroom.

This philosophy is visible in my projects. Whether I am developing a **TSP (Traveling Salesperson Problem) Visualization Dashboard** or conducting research on **Advanced Kalman Filtering**, my goal is always clarity and application. I leverage tools like **Python** and **MATLAB** not just to solve problems, but to visualize the solution process, creating educational assets that demystify high-level mathematics.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities in the **Gulf region** where I can contribute to both advanced curriculum development and meaningful technical research. I am eager to apply my skills in an environment that values technical excellence and the pedagogical foresight to share it.
